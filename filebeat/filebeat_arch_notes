Whole idea is to ship the container logs to the elasticsearch 

step1"
what needs to be done is : create containers with on share  volume where the apps logs needs to be exposed 
Note: you can use --volumes-from option while createing containers.
Refe docker-compose notes 

step2:
Create a another container for the filebeat which again have the access to share path mentioned in the step1
To execute file beat use the command 
filebeat -e

Step3:
configure the filebeat in the container in step2 and mention the IP of logstash and restart the filebeat 
monitorin the logs of file beat.
